          <div class="title-overlay">The Origin of Coffee</div>
          <div class="desc-overlay">Coffee originated in Ethiopia, Africa, and is said to have been discovered by shepherd Kaldi. It was introduced to the Arab region in the 15th century and became an important component of Middle Eastern culture. In the 16th century, coffee spread to Türkiye and Europe, quickly swept all countries, and gave birth to the first batch of coffee shops. Since the 17th century, with trade and colonial expansion, coffee cultivation has been introduced to Asia, America, and other regions, gradually expanding globally. Nowadays, coffee has become one of the most popular beverages in the world, integrated into different cultures and daily lives.</div>

          <div class="title-overlay">Craftsmanship</div>
          <div class="desc-overlay">The coffee making process includes multiple key steps: firstly, selecting high-quality coffee beans, carefully roasting them to release aroma and flavor; Next, grind the baked beans into a suitable thickness for brewing; Then, the essence of coffee can be extracted by means of hand washing, Italian concentration or French press pot to control the water temperature, water flow and time. Finally, milk, sugar, or floral decoration can be added according to preference. A good cup of coffee embodies time, technique, and dedication to details.</div>

          <div class="desc-overlay">Coffee and art blend together to create a unique aesthetic of life. From latte art to coffee cup design, every detail embodies creativity and craftsmanship. Coffee shops often serve as platforms for art exhibitions, carrying various forms of creation such as painting, photography, and handicrafts, allowing people to taste coffee while experiencing the warmth of art. Whether it's a painting, a melody, or a delicate latte, coffee is not just a beverage, but also an artistic medium that inspires inspiration and conveys emotions.</div>

          <div class="title-overlay">The story continues</div>
          <div class="desc-overlay">Every morning, familiar faces walk into the coffee shop, order a cup of coffee they often drink, and sit in their accustomed seats. They exchanged a few pleasantries with the shop assistant, opened their books or turned on their computers, and began their own quiet time. Over time, names, flavors, and habits were silently recorded, and a cup of coffee became a tacit understanding between each other. This is not only a place to drink coffee, but also a corner that connects life and emotions. Welcome to become a part of this story as well.</div>
